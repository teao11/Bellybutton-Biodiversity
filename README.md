# Bellybutton-Biodiversity

## Overview
This challenge was designed to help us develop skills in Javascript, HTML and plotly. Personally this was a very tough module, as I am not particularly keen on leveraging HTML / Javascript, however it was particularly interesting to get some foundational knowledge in how I would create an interactive dashboard if needed.

## Results
The product of this module was to create a three-component dashboard that analyzed various samples of bellybutton data. This dashboard was designed to be interactive, and takes user input that changes the data being displayed.
